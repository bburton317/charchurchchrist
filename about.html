  <h2>About Us</h2>


  <div class="container">
    <p>Do you enjoy worshipping and studying with dedicated, loving Christians? If so, you would enjoy the Charlotte church of Christ. We are drawn together by common faith in Jesus Christ. We profess to be only Christians, called together into fellowship in Christ's spiritual body. Christ promised to establish this body when He said, "I will build my church" (Matthew 16:18). As an independent congregation with no denominational ties, we honor Christ as the only head of the church and are convinced that divisions between Christians destroy the unity for which Christ prayed.</p>
    <p>We believe that if all will worship God in the simple, sincere way the early church worshipped and will preach the same plan of salvation the apostles preached, we will have the same undenominational Christianity today that they had in New Testament times.</p>
    <p>We have a deep respect for the Bible as God's inspired word. We accept what the apostle Paul taught when he said the inspired scriptures have been given "for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work" (II Timothy 3:16). Because we believe the Bible is a sufficient guide, we strive to work and worship as the New Testament teaches.</p>
    <p>In our worship assembiles the holy scriptures are read, studied, and expounded upon. Psalms, hymns, and spiritual psalms are sung by the entire congregation. Prayers are offered to God the Father through and in the name of Jesus Christ. Members voluntarily contribute to support the ministry of the church. The Lord's Supper is observed weekly in remembrance of the crucified and risen Christ. In addition, we offer Bible classes for all ages and encourage individual Bible study in several ways.</p>
    <p>We exist to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ, hoping others might enjoy the "salvation that is in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory" (II Timothy 2:10). We want everyone to know God's love and His wonderful plan to bring us to Him through faith in Jesus Christ. Since faith must be accompanied by obedience, those outside of Christ are taught to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of the living God, confess their faith in Christ, repent of their sins, and be "buried with Him in baptism" (Romans 6:4), immersed in water "for the forgiveness of... sins" (Acts 2:38).</p>
    <p>We believe the church serves the community primarily by teaching God's word. The work of the Lord's church is not social, but spiritual. Thus we respond to the community's spiritual needs as well as those of our own members.</p>
